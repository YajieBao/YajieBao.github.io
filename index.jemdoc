Welcome to my homepage!\n
\n
I am currently a postdoc scholar at [http://en.stat.nankai.edu.cn School of Statistics and Data Science], Nankai University. My advisor is Prof. [http://web.stat.nankai.edu.cn/chlzou/ Changliang Zou]. 
I obtained my PhD degree in Statistics from [http://www.math.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University] under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/show.php?id=35 Dong Han] and Prof. [https://sites.google.com/view/haojieren Haojie Ren].
I virtually visited Prof. [https://mingrliu.github.io/index.html Mingrui Liu]'s lab at George Mason University from 2022-2024. I received my B.S. degree in Statistics from [http://stat.ecnu.edu.cn East China Normal University].\n
