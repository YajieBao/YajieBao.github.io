== About Me
I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at [http://www.math.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University]. Before coming to SJTU, I received my B.S. degree in Statistics from [http://stat.ecnu.edu.cn East China Normal University].
I have been working with [https://mingrliu.github.io/index.html Mingrui Liu] on federated learning and deep learning theory since November 2021. I was fortunate to visit Prof. [http://web.stat.nankai.edu.cn/chlzou/ Changliang Zou]'s group at Nankai University from April-August, 2023.

I will be a postdoc at School of Statistics and Data Science, Nankai University, and supervised by Prof. [http://web.stat.nankai.edu.cn/chlzou/ Changliang Zou].
